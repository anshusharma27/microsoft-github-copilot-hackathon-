  3.Choose a weather forecasting API and get an API key.
  4.Use GitHub Copilot to import required libraries.
  5.Write code using GitHub Copilot to integrate the weather API.
  6.Process and display the weather data using code snippets suggested by Copilot.
  7.Comply with API usage terms and conditions.
